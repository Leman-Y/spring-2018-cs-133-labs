I spent 1 hour in class on the lab

Outside, I spent 3 hours.

For some reason for my doctest TASK E
	CHECK( ppos -> z == 107.7);
	107.7 is equal to 107.7 but I am getting a failure

The same goes for my doctest TASK F
	tests.cpp(119) ERROR!
	CHECK( getPosition(p).x == 44.5 )
	with expansion:
	CHECK( 44.5 == 44.5 )

I have no idea why I am getting this error when they obviously equal each other.
