Collective review for five.md (Shania, Marin, Muskan)
"
Before implementing the spec:

All,

Missing API specification (i.e. declarations).
Splitting between people is decent. 
Cheating should be impossible to begin with.

After implementing the spec:
-Spec needs function declarations and what each function returns.
-Specs are too general and should be like the labs aka be more detailed.
